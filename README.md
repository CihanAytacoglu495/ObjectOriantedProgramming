## ObjectOriantedProgramming
# OOP Application

*With this c# application I have made, the subject of inheritance, which is often confused about object-oriented programming, is discussed. While dealing with the subject of inheritince, various classes were created and relations between classes were included. The names of the classes created were inspired by a series called "Game of Thorones". In this project, a project has been created by addressing the very confusing topics such as object creation, inheritance, abstract classes, interface classes, object creation within the class. You can see the operation of the event by integrating the application I have made into your own c # application and running it step by step. (Debug mode)*
